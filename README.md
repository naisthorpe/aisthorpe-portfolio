# Nicholas Aisthorpe Portfolio

## What

    This is my portfolio that will house coding projects that I complete during my coding course at UNC Charlotte.

----------

## Why

    This portfolio will act as a hub for my contact information, projects, and resume. I will be updating it regularly as I complete projects.

----------

## How

    I created this site with HTML and CSS. I started by setting up my HTML structure and then used CSS to style the page. The site is mobile-responsive and focuses on accessibility.
